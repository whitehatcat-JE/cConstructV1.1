SQL Queries needed:
Adding terrain:
	Add piece to dataPointID
	For each feature:
		Check if feature in featureCodes, else add feature
		Add featureID to dataPointID
	Add stair data if any

Removing terrain:
	Delete piece from dataPointID (storing ID temporarily)
	Delete dataPointID from featureIDs
	Delete stair data if any

Cleaning DB:
	Delete any featureCodes not associated with any dataPointIDs

Retrieving needed terrain:
	Get dataPointIDs that match coordinate parameters
	Merge featureIDs with featureCodes where dataPointID in previous query and send new table
	Get any stair data
